## Web App - Album Libray 🎶
In this web app you can find top albums of your favorite artists. And you can find more information and songs from that album.

### Web App Link 
You can find the web app [here](https://sanneduinkerx.github.io/web-app-from-scratch-2021/).

### Process 📈
The **process** of web app can be found [here](https://github.com/sanneduinkerx/web-app-from-scratch-2021/wiki/Proces).

## API - LastFM 🎵

I've chosen the LastFM API and load the top albums from artists. The user can search for favorite artists and get top albums from that artist. Info about the API can be found [here](https://www.last.fm/api/show/artist.getTopAlbums).
