# Web App From Scratch @cmda-minor-web 2020 - 2021 

In this course i learn to build a web application with vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript. I will learn how to retrieve data from an API of my own choosing.

## Web App - Album Libray
In this web app you can find top albums of your favorite artists. And you can find more information and songs from that album.

You can find the web app [here](https://sanneduinkerx.github.io/web-app-from-scratch-2021/)
The proces of web app can be found [here](https://github.com/sanneduinkerx/web-app-from-scratch-2021/wiki/Proces).

## chosen API - Music API LastFM

I've chosen the LastFM API and load the top albums from artists. The user can search for favorite artists and get top albums from that artist. Info about the API can be found [here](https://www.last.fm/api/show/artist.getTopAlbums)

## Diagrams 🗂
The Diagrams will change over time in this project when more actors are added later on.

<!-- Proces -->
<!-- Week1: This week I retrieved data from the LastFM API and rendered it in an overview page. As example i used ACDC to get all their top albums. i didn't put an input field, put i do want to put that in the web app. So the user can search different artists. -->

<!-- Week 2: this week i split up my code into modules, also addeda new feature  -->
